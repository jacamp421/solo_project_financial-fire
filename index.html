    <h1 class = "intro__header header" >🔥What is finanical F.I.R.E?🔥</h1>
    <p class = "intro__paragraph">Financial F.I.R.E. stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. In a sense, you have to be incredibly frugal and invest nearly all of your income to then be able to retire much earlier than the U.S. retirement age of 59 ½ years old.</p>
    <img class ="intro__img"src="./images/early_retirement.jpg">
      
    <h1 class = "intro__header header">Word to the wise</h1>
    <p class = "intro__paragraph">It is imperative that you understand that this goal is not for everybody. Furthermore, it is human nature to seek a sense of purpose, and if that is through a job, then this approach is not recommended!</p>
    <p class = "intro__paragraph"> Futhermore! I am not suggesting any one path of investments, you need to do your own research in finding areas to put your money to have it work for you!</p>

    <h1 class = "tools__header header">Tools!</h1>
    <p class = "tools__subheader">Here are useful tools you can use. I have no ties to these companies; I personally use them because of their usefulness, and I believe you should too!</p>

    <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/" class = "tools_link">Fidelity</a>
    <p class="tools__paragraph">Fidelity is one of the largest and most reputable financial institutions in the U.S., offering a wide range of services including brokerage accounts, retirement planning, robo-advisors (like Fidelity Go), and full-service wealth management. It's known for:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Low-cost index funds and ETFs
        </li>
        <li>
          No account minimums for many services
        </li>
        <li>
          Strong research tools and customer support
        </li>
        <li>
          Flexible investing options (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class = "tools__paragraph">While stocks form the backbone of most long-term investment strategies, it’s wise to diversify into real assets like raw materials (e.g. gold, silver, oil, agricultural commodities) — especially as the U.S. dollar continues to gradually lose purchasing power over time due to inflation and monetary policy.</p>

    <div class="info">
      <h1 class="info__header header">What is an asset?</h1>
      <p class ="info__paragraph">“An asset is anything that puts money in your pocket — whether you work or not.”
In Robert Kiyosaki’s world (from Rich Dad Poor Dad), assets aren’t just things you own — they’re things that generate income or grow in value over time.</p>
<h2 class = "info__subheader">🟩 Real Assets (According to Kiyosaki)</h2>
<p class="info__paragraph">These are examples of what he considers true assets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
🏠 Rental properties — generate passive income
  </li>
   <li>
   📈 Stocks / dividends — give you regular payouts 
  </li>
   <li>
    🧠 Businesses you own — earn money without trading time
  </li>
   <li>
    💎 Gold, silver, raw materials — hold value as the dollar declines
  </li>
   <li>
    💻 Intellectual property — like books, patents, or digital products
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="info__subheader">🟥 What’s NOT an Asset? (Even if it looks like one)</h2> 
<p class="info__paragraph">Kiyosaki says many people are fooled into thinking certain things are assets when they’re actually liabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
🚗 Cars — lose value, cost money to maintain
  </li>
    <li>
    🏡 Your personal home — doesn’t put cash in your pocket
  </li>
    <li>
    🎓 Expensive degrees — unless they generate a return
  </li>
    <li>
    💳 Credit cards / consumer debt — drain your income
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="info__subheader">🔑 Bottom Line:</h2>
<p class="info__paragraph">"The rich buy assets. The poor and middle class buy liabilities, thinking they’re assets."</p>
<p class="info__paragraph">Your job on the path to financial freedom (and FIRE)?
Stack real assets. Let them pay for your lifestyle.</p>
