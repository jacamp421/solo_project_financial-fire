    <h1 class = "intro-fire__header" >What is finanical F.I.R.E?</h1>
    <p class = "intro-fire__paragraph">Financial F.I.R.E. stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. In a sense, you have to be incredibly frugal and invest nearly all of your income to then be able to retire much earlier than the U.S. retirement age of 59 Â½ years old.</p>
    <h1 class = "intro-fire__header">Word to the wise</h1>
    <p class = "intro-fire__paragraph">It is imperative that you understand that this goal is not for everybody. Furthermore, it is human nature to seek a sense of purpose, and if that is through a job, then this approach is not recommended!</p>
    <p class = "intro-fire__paragraph"> Futhermore! I am not suggesting any one path of investments, you need to do your own research in finding areas to put your money to have it work for you!</p>
